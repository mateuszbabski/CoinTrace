## Refactored project

In purpose of learning I refactored again previous project.
I cleaned code a little and decided to use Services instead of CQRS since budget tracker is pretty simple project.
I added unit tests.

I won't (probably) add any front-end to most of my projects and try to keep focus on learning the back side of them.
