# CleanArchitecture-Identity-Template
Identity user template in Clean Architecture

Most of things I've been trying to do in my own way. I dont really like identity implemented by MS so I made my simple one with the most important things.
Easy to upgrade, easy to update and change. Without a mess in database.

Simple template with custom implementation of:
- register user
- login/authenticate user
- change password

To be implemented:
- reset password
- forgot password
